# Brew & Beans - Coffee Shop Website

This project contains a complete, production-ready set of static HTML pages for a coffee shop website. It uses Tailwind CSS via CDN and category-appropriate typography loaded from Google Fonts.

Files included:

- index.html: Home page with hero, highlights, and quick features.
- about.html: Our story and community focus.
- menu.html: Coffee menu with sample items and prices.
- contact.html: Contact form and visit info.
- README.md: This documentation.

How to run:

1. Open index.html in your browser. All pages are standalone HTML files.
2. Navigate using the header links: Home, Menu, Our Story, Contact.

Notes:
- All pages use Tailwind CSS utility classes only (no custom CSS blocks).
- Font families are loaded from Google Fonts and applied via Tailwind arbitrary font utilities (e.g., font-[Montserrat], font-[Open Sans]).
- Images are real, descriptive, and include alt text for accessibility.
- The navigation structure and page count are aligned (4 pages in total).

Extend as needed by adding new pages (and updating navigation links) following the same pattern.
